# DevOps Project: WordPress Website Hosting on AWS

## Overview

This project aims to deploy a WordPress website on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using various AWS services and best practices in DevOps. Below is a detailed guide on the architecture and deployment process.

## Architecture

The architecture of the WordPress website hosting on AWS consists of the following components:

1. **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**:
   - Configured with public and private subnets across two availability zones for enhanced reliability and fault tolerance.

2. **Internet Gateway**:
   - Facilitates connectivity between VPC instances and the wider Internet.

3. **Security Groups**:
   - Acts as a network firewall mechanism to control traffic to EC2 instances.

4. **Availability Zones**:
   - Utilized to enhance system reliability and fault tolerance.

5. **EC2 Instances (Web Servers)**:
   - Deployed within private subnets for enhanced security.
   - Accessed via EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint for secure connection.

6. **NAT Gateway**:
   - Enables instances in private subnets to access the Internet.

7. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**:
   - Distributes web traffic evenly to an Auto Scaling Group of EC2 instances across multiple availability zones.
   - Configured with a target group for routing traffic.

8. **Auto Scaling Group**:
   - Automatically manages EC2 instances to ensure website availability, scalability, fault tolerance, and elasticity.

9. **GitHub**:
   - Web files stored for version control and collaboration.

10. **Certificate Manager**:
    - Secures application communication using SSL/TLS certificates.

11. **Simple Notification Service (SNS)**:
    - Configured to alert about activities within the Auto Scaling Group.

12. **Route 53**:
    - Registered domain name and set up DNS records.

13. **RDS (Relational Database Service)**:
    - Deployed for database management.

14. **EFS (Elastic File System)**:
    - Deployed for scalable and elastic file storage.

15. **Bastion Host**:
    - Used to access the private network for application installation.
